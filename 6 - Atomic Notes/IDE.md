# IDE

**Definition:** IDE stands for Integrated Development Environment. These are commonly software applications which provide many tools to enhance the developer experience. An IDE normally consists of at least a source-code editor, build automation tools, and a debugger

## Source Code Editor: 
- **Definition:** This is typically what people think of when they picture a IDE. There are countless code editors out there for people to choose and while they all essentially serve the same purpose they offer differing levels of efficiency and at different pricing points. These code editors help you write code with some [[Programming Languages]]
- Common Examples
	- [[Visual Studio Code ]]
	- [[IntelliJ]]
	- [[Eclipse]]
	- [[Vim]]
	- [[PyCharm]]
	- [[Xcode]]
	- [[Zed]]

### Debugger: 
- This has been something which I've been meaning to get more used to using in my code
- I've found it to be really useful as it can provide a lot more information about variables as it can show a lot of information depending on where you choose on putting in breakpoints
	
	An example of me using a debugger was for one of my [[Personal Projects]] which was [[Chess]]
- ##### [[Chess]]
	- I used a debugger extensively during my development of chess as it was something that really helped me understand why I was getting certain issues in my code
