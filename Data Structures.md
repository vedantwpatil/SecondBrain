# Data Structures

## Overview 

This note looks to be a index of all the data structures and hold the links to jump to any of them. 

Data structures are a fundamental concept in computer science and programming which studys different ways to organize and store data. They provide a way to manage large amounts of information and optmize algorithms for better performance.

### Typs of Data Structures

There are 2 main groups in data structures 

#### Linear Data Structures:
- [[Arrays]]
- [[Linked Lists]]
- [[Stacks]]
- [[Queues]]

#### Non-Linear Data Structures:
- [[Trees]]
- [[Graphs]]
- [[Hash Tables]]

### Common Data Structures

#### Arrays 

[[Arrays]] are collections of elements sotred in contiguous memory locations. They provide fast access to elements useing indices but have a fixed size. 

#### Linked Lists

[[Linked lists]] consists of nodes where each node contains data and a reference/pointer to the next node. They allow for efficient insertion and deletion but slower access to elements. 

#### Stacks 

[[Stacks]] follow the Last-In-First-Out principle. They are useful for operations like undo/redo, expression evaluation, and function call management. 

#### Queues

[[Queues]] follow the First-In-First-Out principle. They are commonly used in scenarios like task scheduling and [[breadth-first-search]] algorithms.
