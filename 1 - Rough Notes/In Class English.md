# In Class English

**Takeaway:** I learned to write in a more dramatic way and to emphasize certain details like character traits to make the reader feel more engaged and interested in my writing. Something that the class really emphasized was to show and not to tell, I felt this was the biggest takeaway I had from this class as it was something mentioned almost every time we read our classmates response until people began to learn how to better demonstrate these things. 

**Future Writing:** From my knowledge of my field, the writing I'll be doing needs to be monotone as the only times i see myself really writing is when writing reports about the assignments/work I've done in a day as a software engineer.
