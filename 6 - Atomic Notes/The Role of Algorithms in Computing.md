# The Role of Algorithms in Computing

**Notes:**

##### Definitions:
**Algorithm:** Any clearly defined procedure which takes in an input and outputs a change 
**Data Structures:** Ways to organize and store data, each one of them have their own strengths and weaknesses
**NP-Complete Problems:** These are problems where there are no efficient algorithms but there has never been a proof that an efficient solution cannot exist
**Parallelism:** The act of running multiple tasks simultaneously across different hardware.
**Loop Invariant:** A way of checking if the algorithm is correct


##### Sorts: 
[[Insertion Sort]]
[[Merge Sort]]

In most cases merge sort is more efficient than insertion sort despite small cases, to demonstrate these differences in speed there is a constant $c$ to depict this
### Conclusion: 
Despite many concepts in programming not requiring algorithms, these applications will always run on some type of hardware which will use algorithms to run efficiently 

## Analysis of Algorithms
When analyzing algorithms, you can't directly just run them on a computer because of the amount of variables which can affect the runtime on that particular machine. Also this only measures the runtime for those particular conditions and can't be used as a general measure for all computers/use cases
