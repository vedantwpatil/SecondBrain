# Xcode

**Definition:** [IDE] made by apple for app development on apple devices. 

## Thoughts:
- I don't really enjoy using Xcode as I find it kind of clunky as well as working with [[Swift]]/[[SwiftUI]] is somewhat frustrating
- My frustrations come with how I am trying to learn many different [[Programming Languages]]
