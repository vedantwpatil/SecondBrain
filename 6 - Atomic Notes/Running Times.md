# Running Times
When analyzing algorithms it is important to have a concreate way of differentiating which one is better than the other. One of these ways of differentiating is running time and seeing how fast the algorithm runs in comparison to the other. 

### Different Ways of Evaluating Speed
There are 3 different symboles we use to evalute the speed of an algorithm 

They are O, thetha, and omega with each symbol representing a different condition. This notation is often called Big O notation and is used to differentiate the speeds of algorithms. 

When speaking about algorithms although an algorithm may have the same speed across all its fields, it is important to be concise and accurate while describing an algorithm's speed. The example of this is although 0(n), thetha(n) and omega(n) may all be correct ways to describe [[Insertion Sort|insertion Sort]]s speed, the most precise way of saying this is thetha(n)

However this is the standard amongst those who are deeply into studying algorithms and is not very commonly used terminalogy outside of that field. So it is unlikely to be encountering this terminalogy that frequently unless studying you are studying algorithms directly.
