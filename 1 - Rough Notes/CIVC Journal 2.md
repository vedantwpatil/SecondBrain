# CIVC Journal 2

Journal entries allow you to demonstrate engagement with the course concepts. In this first entry, please reflect on the week 3 content and week 4 discussion and address the following questions:Â 

1. What are your major takeaways/questions from the Week 3 content and Week 4 discussion? Cite specific examples of content and discussion points that resonated with you or left you with further questions.
2. What personal reflections do you have from both the content and the virtual discussion? How does your own experience with community/civic engagement relate to the concepts discussed? What have you thought more about as a result of this content and these discussions?

I found that my personal experiences can really obstruct my desire to find out all the important and relevant information. This is something I've been looking to correct, but it's always something that's important to sit back and reflect upon. I was born into a financially stable family that was able to provide for all my personal desires, despite it not always being the objectively correct thing for me to have. Despite not having a complete family and childhood, I still had many privileges that many other people may not have or get the chance to experience. This can be a massive handicap in my evaluation and my treatment of others, as there are lots of microassessments and judgments we make of others the moment we see them based on their outer appearance. If they have more expressive physical traits, such as using their hair as a form of expression, among other things, there are certain assumptions we make about the person, despite the accuracy of those assumptions. We may judge someone as creative or alternative based on their hairstyle without truly knowing them. It's important to recognize that these snap judgments can be harmful and limiting in our interactions with others. By acknowledging the biases we hold and making an effort to look past outward appearances, we can foster more genuine connections and understanding with those around us. We must remember that everyone has a unique story and personality that goes beyond what meets the eye.
