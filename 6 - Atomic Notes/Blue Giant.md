**Definition:** This story is about how a regular person picks up a saxophone and becomes obsessed with in and becoming the best jazz player in the world. 

I found this series to be really intriguing, primarily because of how intense the series felt and how much I felt it reach out to me. The series really grasped me as I also was a musician earlier in life and really enjoyed my time playing music.
