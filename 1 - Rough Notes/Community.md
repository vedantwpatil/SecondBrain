# Community

**Definition:** Tell us about a community that you recently joined (can be anything you'd like - a student group, a book club, an online community, etc.). What was it like to be part of a new group of people? How did you introduce yourself? What actions did that community take to welcome you and make you feel a sense of belonging? If they didn't take any actions or you don't feel a sense of belonging, what could they have done to give you that comfort level in the community?
