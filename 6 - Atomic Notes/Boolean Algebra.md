Boolean algebra is a fundamental branch of math that revolves around logical operations and binary values. 

## Basic Concepts
Boolean algebra operates on binary values, typically represented as:
- 1 or TRUE
- 0 or FALSE

## Core Operations 
There are three primary Boolean operations and they are: 
- Conjunction (AND): Denoted by ^
- Disjunction (OR): Denoted by v 
- Negation (NOT): Denoted by Â¬

## Truth Tables
Truth tables are a essential concept in boolean algebra and are a way of demonstrating all the possible outcomes of a boolean operation. 

## Computer Science Application 
Computers revolve around boolean algebra since all the hardware is built off of logic gates which are evaluted as either true or false (1 or 0).
