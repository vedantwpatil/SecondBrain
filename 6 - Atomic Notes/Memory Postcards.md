# Memory Postcards
**Definition:** This is for an english assignment where I am meant to take the setting and background mentioned by a relative or somebody I look up to and redescribed the entire moment for them but as an author. 

### Contexts:
In addition to a memory postcard, a blurb of context is used before the text to inform the reader about the situation.

## Postcard 1 
  
"So, will you switch your major to electrical engineering?" The dean of the college asked. I found myself heavily disoriented in the office of an institution I never imagined attending. Looking around, it seemed like I had been transported to an alternate reality where everything looked out of place. The buildings would tower over me, with each step further into the campus feeling as if I were being swallowed by the grandeur and prestige of the institution. I looked to gain familiarity and comfort from the people opposed to the vast architecture, only to find that the people were just as intimidating and distant as the buildings themselves. Our campus tour guide was dressed in the eye-catching colors of the university, with all the other people looking just as out of place. I quickly extinguished the thought, "Why did I go here?" when I remembered the alumni and the opportunities that come out of this school. The compelling ideas of my possible postgraduate life were unable to quell the doubting thoughts as we continued to walk around the campus.

"Here we are!" The tour guide had exclaimed with enthusiasm that I would never understand

We were brought to the main building, where the faculty were gathered with welcoming smiles stretched across their faces, which only made me feel more uneasy. The principal began to blabber on about the prestige of the school and the great pride we should have as students of such a school. He would begin to call each of us into his room one by one for a private meeting.
