# Chess

**Definition:** Chess is a board game which has a simple amount of rules but large amounts of complexities higher up. 

**Implementation:** For one of my first [[Personal Projects]] I made a chess implementation with [[Java]], this part was simple however I found myself running into many difficulties when using [[Java Swing]] to make the [[GUI]]. The main issues I found myself running into was drawing the board but using tools like [[ChatGPT]] I was able to finally figure out the issues I was running into and finally was able to say that it was completed.

**Chess Engine:**
- When making my implementation I started developing a chess engine to be able to analyze a position and accurately dictate what is the best move to play taking into consideration all the best moves black and white would play. Although I found it really fascinating to work on this would be something that I would come to stop working on as I found myself rather working on other projects to enhance my career as a [[Software Engineer]] or as a [[AI Engineer]]. These are 2 career paths that I think I would enjoy and find fulfillment. Additionally, I have been considering trying to become something in [[Quant]] but i'm not as sure if thats the path for me as much as become a [[Software Engineer]]
