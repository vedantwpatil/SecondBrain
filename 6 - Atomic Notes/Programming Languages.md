# Programming Languages

**Definition:** Programming languages are the ways that we communicate with computers with each of them having their own syntax and providing different developer experiences. 

Computers and machines are really strong at calculations. The study behind this is [[Boolean Algebra]] and [[Discrete Math]]. 

Computers are able to compute thousands of calculations in milliseconds. Due to this strength we've had them interpret the world in numbers. There are many different ways of interpreting numbers and the way that we commonly express them is in [[Base 10]] or in the Decimal numeral system. Computers understand the world in [[Base 2]] or Binary which is just 1s and 0s. Additionally there are different ways of interpreting binary and representing numbers in binary such as [[Ones Complement]], [[Twos Complement]] and [[Signed Magnitude]]. These are all concepts you learn in [[Computer Science]]

There are many programming languages with each of them serving their own purpose
