# Data Structures

## Overview 

This note looks to be a index of all the data structures and hold the links to jump to any of them. 

Data structures are a fundamental concept in computer science and programming which study different ways to organize and store data. They provide a way to manage large amounts of information and optimize algorithms for better performance.

### Types of Data Structures

There are 2 main groups in data structures 

#### Linear Data Structures:
- [[Arrays]]
- [[Linked Lists]]
- [[Stacks]]
- [[Queues]]

#### Non-Linear Data Structures:
- [[Trees]]
- [[Graphs]]
- [[Hash Tables]]

### Common Data Structures

#### Arrays 

[[Arrays]] are collections of elements stored in contiguous memory locations. They provide fast access to elements using indices but have a fixed size. 

#### Linked Lists

[[Linked lists]] consists of nodes where each node contains data and a reference/pointer to the next node. They allow for efficient insertion and deletion but slower access to elements. 

#### Stacks 

[[Stacks]] follow the Last-In-First-Out principle. They are useful for operations like undo/redo, expression evaluation, and function call management. 

#### Queues

[[Queues]] follow the First-In-First-Out principle. They are commonly used in scenarios like task scheduling and [[breadth-first-search]] algorithms. 

#### Trees 

[[Trees]] are hierarchical structures with a root node and child node. [[Binary Trees]], [[Binary Search Trees]], and balanced trees like [[Red-Black Tree]] and [[AVL]] are popular variants. 

#### Graphs 

[[Graphs]] consist of vertices (nodes) and edges connecting them. They are used to represent networks, relationships, and complex systems. 

#### Hash Tables 

[[Hash Tables]] provide fast insertion, deletion, and lookup operations using a hash function to map keys to array indices. 

## Importance of Data Structures
- Efficiency: Proper choice of data structures can significantly improve algorithm performance. 
- Organization: They help in organizing and managing large amount of data effectively. 
- Abstraction: Data structures provide a level of abstraction, allowing developers to focus on high-level operations. 
- Re usability: Well-implemented data structures can be reused across different projects and applications. 

### Choosing the Right Data Structure 

Selecting the appropriate data structure depends on factors such as 
- The type of data being stored 
- The operations to be performed (e.g, frequent insertions, deletions, or searches)
- Memory constraints
- Time complexity requirements 

Understanding the characteristics and trade-offs of different data structures is crucial for efficient algorithm design and implementation
