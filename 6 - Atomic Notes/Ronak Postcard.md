Dear Raina,

I am so grateful to have had the opportunity to interview you and learn more about your life early on. Walking through your experiences allowed me to see how the people and events in your life have influenced the person you have become today. This project was not only a wonderful opportunity to highlight the relationships and emotions you have experienced over the past years but was also an opportunity for us to become closer as family members. I chose you for this project because as cousins we do most of our family events and vacations together and we have a strong bond between each other. Even before this project, I had learned much about you, but this project allowed me to delve into your memories and understand your bond with your sister and how you enjoyed your family vacations. Discovering these aspects of your life made me feel even more connected with you, and it was enjoyable to document your memoires.

The first memory postcard I had wrote made me understand how connected you and your sister really are to each other and how strong your relationship is. When talking about your sister you showed me how important of a person she was in your life. You specifically talked to me about different moments on the catamaran where she would talk to you or laugh at you for something stupid you did. This was able to make me understand how connected the 2 of you are as siblings. One of the things I found difficult about this memory was how you stated the memory in a timeline throughout the day. It was hard to specifically get you to focus on one specific part of the memory because you did not remember much because you were young when this happened. On the contrary, you were able to successfully describe the scene and what was around you and incorporate your emotions throughout.

When interviewing you the main challenge I felt was trying to get you to focus more on a moment in specific instead of sharing about the entire day. In the story, I wanted to write about the entire day because when you told the story you seemed to enjoy and acted like you relived the moment in your head, but I also wanted to focus and blow up on one specific moment. It was hard for me to write about the entire day but also focus more on the one specific moment I got you to share about that day because of not only the word limit but also because of how much you shared happened that day. I was successfully able to narrow down the key topics to share and also talk about one specific moment in particular while also showing character and emotion throughout.

Thank you,

Ronak Patel

Amidst the clear blue waters of Santorini, Greece, my family embarked on a sun-kissed voyage aboard a luxurious catamaran, graciously guided by a seasoned captain and his culinary wife. As the boat sliced through the waves, the sun painted a shimmered pathway of gold upon and exclamations of awe as we passed by unique coastal villages and jagged cliffs adorned with whitewashed buildings and blue floors. My cousin Raina and my sister Riya were there the entire time, talking and laughing, adding to the joyous atmosphere. The highlight of the voyage came when we anchored near a secluded beach nestled within the embrace of an ancient volcano. With a splash and a chorus of excited shouts, we leaped into the crystalline waters, our bodies slicing through the cool embrace of the seat with effortless grace. My 18-year-old sister Riya who was afraid to swim, watched from the catamaran as my cousin, father, uncle, and I all swam towards the small beach. My cousin and I were brutally hurt by the feeling of chipped seashells and curvy rocks rubbing against our naked feet. Hours slipped by unnoticed and eventually the captain shouted, “Come back everyone, it is time for the next stop!” Reluctantly we made our way back to the catamaran with different shells we found along the beach and even lave rocks that washed up on shore. The captain moved the catamaran out towards sea as he sailed to find the perfect spot to watch the sun set over the horizon waters. The sun leaving an orange and pink color not only in the skies but also against the waters. My family and I all not only admiring how this was the most beautiful sunset we have ever witnessed, but also forging memories that would linger in our hearts long after the sun had set.

## Ronak Postcard 2

Bounded by the crystal-clear waters of the Bahamas, my parents and I embarked on an adventure I would never forget. We arrived at a secluded cove, where the turquoise sea shimmered invitingly under the bright sun. Guided by Diane, our experienced instructor, we eagerly put on our snorkeling gear while the anticipation bubbled within us like the gentle waves lapping against the shore.

As we swam into the warm waters, I felt a mix of excitement and nervousness coursing through my veins. “Look beta,” my mom exclaimed as a sleek silhouette glided gracefully beneath the surface of the water. Without a second to waste, I followed her gaze and there it was, a dolphin, its fin cutting through the water like a knife through butter.

“Wow,” I breathed, scarcely believing my eyes as the dolphin drew nearer, its inquisitive eyes staring into my soul. With a gentle nudge from Diane, I reached our tentatively, feeling the dolphin’s smooth, rubbery skin beneath my fingertips. It was surreal, like touching a living embodiment of the ocean itself.

My dad, standing by the edge of the water holding the camera, watched proudly capturing every moment on camera with an enthusiastic smile plastered across his face. “Go rainy!” he exclaimed using the nickname he calls me, his excitement contagious as he captured this once in a lifetime experience.

The dolphins, seemingly sense our joy, began to dance us in playful circles and communicated with us using clicks and whistles which echoed through the crystalline waters. “They are so beautiful,” I whispered, my voice filled with awe as they leapt out of the water in graceful arcs splashing water all over us while landing back in the water.

What felt like only a few minutes turned out to be 45 minutes full of laughter and memories while watching the dolphins in their playful nature. It was a magical day, one that left me with memories of a bond with nature and my family that I would cherish forever.
