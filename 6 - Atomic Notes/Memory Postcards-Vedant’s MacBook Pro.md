# Memory Postcards
**Definition:** This is for an english assignment where I am meant to take the setting and background mentioned by a relative or somebody I look up to and redescribed the entire moment for them but as an author. 

### Contexts:
I interviewed my father because I felt that it was unfair that he so much about my life and I knew hardly anything about his. I asked him about his time at college and his experience was. My father began to smile while telling the story, reminiscing while also remembering all the dumb mistakes he made and stressed about. This story felt a lot like a lesson but because of the comedic aspect of it i didn't mind and found it enjoyable and a memory worth writing about.

"So, will you switch your major to electrical engineering?" The dean of the college asked. I found myself heavily disoriented in the office of an institution I never imagined attending. Looking around, it seemed like I had been transported to an alternate reality where everything looked out of place.

I looked around the buildings towering over me, with each step further into the campus feeling as if I were being swallowed by the grandeur and prestige of the institution. I looked to gain familiarity and comfort from the people opposed to the vast architecture, only to find that the people were just as intimidating and distant as the buildings themselves. Our campus tour guide was dressed in the eye-catching colors of the university, with all the other people looking just as out of place. I quickly extinguished the thought, "Why did I go here?" when I remembered the alumni and the opportunities that come out of this school. The compelling ideas of my possible postgraduate life with my civil engineering degree were unable to quell the doubting thoughts as we continued to walk around the campus.

"Here we are!" The tour guide had exclaimed with enthusiasm that I would never understand

We were brought to the main building, and faculty gathered around with welcoming smiles stretched across their faces, which only made me feel more uneasy. The principal began to blabber on about the prestige of the school and the great pride we should have as students of such a school. He would begin to call each of us into his room one by one for a private meeting. I took a seat outside his door, and my palms began to sweat profusely. The tension was unbearable.

"What's going to happen to me inside of this office? Will my scholarship be revoked? How will my dad react when I return home with this news?"

"Come in"

The principal welcomed me inside with a massive grin on his face. His office was filled with lavish decorations I could never dream of affording, with a small picture of his family on the edge of his desk. As we began speaking, I felt overwhelmed by his proficiency in English, felt myself slowly getting left behind, and began to accept his statements without much thought.

I blinked and found myself back home in our village, uncertain of what just transpired. My father came over to me with massive praise: "You got in for electrical engineering!"

I stood there stunned. "The college rejected me and wasn't offering electrical engineering, though."

"I just got called by your principal, and he spoke to you and said that he offered you to switch to electrical engineering, and you were overjoyed and accepted."

I fell to my seat hearing this news, my mind raced as I tried to piece together what had happened. Had I really made such a big decision without even realizing it? I couldn't believe that my future had been changed in an instant, all because of a simple misunderstanding. Now, I had to figure out how to navigate this new path that had been laid out before me.

### Context:
I interviewed my father again because I believe as my sole parent, he has a massive amount of influence on my life. I asked him to describe how it was to grow up in India at a village. The most interesting things were hearing about the pressures he faced with the difference in time highlighted some cultural differences which both made his childhood more enjoyable and stressful. The picture I pasted below is of him when he was middle/high school.

"Do you think you'll ever leave the village with a mindset like that?"

My mother's voice rang out throughout my ears as I jolted awake from my nap in my bedroom. As I awoke from the nightmare, I disjointedly stumbled around the house and somehow made it out onto the yard. I tried to calm myself down, I took a seat, taking a moment to reflect on her words feeling the hot humid air of India on my face. 

Walking around our garden, I felt a seed of doubt being planted in my mind from my mother's question, wondering if I had the knowledge and ability to make it out of our village. Eventually, I came face-to-face with one of our fruit trees, whose berries were ripe to be harvested. I ran back inside and yelled, "Appa, it's time for a harvest." Excitement was evident in my voice. We had worked so hard to cultivate those fruits and vegetables. Running to gather buckets with my siblings, we were all excited to see the fruits of our labor. We were in an undersized 3-bedroom house for me and my three sisters to share, but we made it work. Meena was the most helpful whenever it came to studying and helping us with our homework. I was struggling to keep up with my grades, but Meena was always there to help out, which is one of the main reasons I could accomplish our parent’s dreams of me becoming an engineer. Despite not having the passion for it, I don't want to pursue engineering and leave that for Meena. However, our parents would never let her attend college; the fact they let her go to high school was unheard of, so it was up to me to fulfill our parent’s dream.

I began to gather our extended family to enjoy our harvest, walking on the rocky path from house to house and seeing children play cricket in the streets. In our village, we relied on makeshift lamps and poor electricity, but the sense of community made up for any technological deficiencies. Having such a strong connection made me wonder if I could really leave this place. Even if my grades were good enough, would it really be worth it to start a new life elsewhere?

The thought of leaving my close-knit community behind weighed heavily on me. However, part of me dreamed of an easier life, one where my needs were easily taken care of without the hard work and struggles commonplace in the village. Part of me knew that this would only be accomplished by attending a top university and moving out into the city, where opportunities for success and advancement were more readily available. The idea of leaving for the unknown challenges of the city terrified me. I never felt as though I had the ability to make a difference in this world. Still, as the deadline for college applications drew nearer, I knew I had a difficult decision to make.
