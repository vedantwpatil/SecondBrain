# Conversations

This note and its thought's were sparked from this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXjgpYevUww which was called the most underated social skill and how I learned it and revolved around the process of [[Active Listening|Active Listening]]. In addition the late night overly deep thoughts are making me think more and more about this concept and am really interested in it and yearn to improve my social skills and likeability.

This had me thinking about how much people just want to be listened to and not really interputed and just thinking about the best ways to become that person. I think I need to reprioritize honing my ability to speak to others and become somebody people really enjoy talking to.

This video resparked my intersted in getting better at conversations, also I've recently had experiences with awkward or difficult conversations and been wanting to imporve myself and have more free flowing fun conversations more often and more easily. Being honest, I feel like it can be easier to talk to somebody completely new as opposed to somebody I already know as there are more questions I can ask to get the know the person otherwise I have to create current events to talk about I guess. The video mentioned just being authentic and saying whatever comes to mind but at the same time I feel somewhat worried about that as I'm not sure it'll be enough to work but we'll try it anyway I guess.
