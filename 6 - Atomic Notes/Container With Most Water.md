# Container With Most Water

You are given an integer array `heights` where `heights[i]` represents the height of the i^th bar. 

You may choose any two bars to form a container. Return the *maximum* amount of water a container can store. 

### Example 1: 
```python
Input: height = [1,7,2,5,4,7,3,6]
Output: 36
```

### Example 2: 
```python
Input: height = [2,2,2]
Output: 4
```
### Constraints:
- 2 <= `height.length` <= 1000
- 0 <= `height[i]` <= 1000 

### Rough Work/Thought Process
