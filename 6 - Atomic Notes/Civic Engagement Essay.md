**Topic:** Writing about how homelessness affects the nearby area and possible solutions to this

The status of our environment is a prevalent issue in our lives that we often disregard, as the effects of poorly treating the environment only appear after tens of years of maltreatment and, by then, are irreversible. One of the biggest issues with cleaning the environment is the lack of care and attention given to the issue. This is often because people have more pressing issues to take care of and disregard the cleanliness of nature for convenience or profit. Recently, there have been plenty of campaigns on how to try and get the youth more involved with cleaning up the earth and making sure that we are able to ensure the health of our planet. These campaigns are all over schools and are moderately effective at teaching people the importance of taking care of the planet, but they are ultimately disregarded out of convenience. Nowadays, there is the question of how to use social media, in particular TikTok, to teach children as well as the rest of the world how important it is to clean the planet. Social media platforms like TikTok have the potential to reach a wide audience and spread awareness about environmental issues in a more captivating way. By creating movements and informative videos, we can engage younger generations and inspire them to take action.  

Tiktok is a social media platform where users share short videos with others on a varying range of topics, from dancing videos to long, informative content. The main appeal of TikTok is the scrolling feature combined with an algorithm that recommends your content. If we are able to make content that people are able to enjoy and find appealing to watch while also being informative about the environment, we can reach thousands, if not millions, of people, with some videos on the app reaching the illustrious 100 million mark, demonstrating the app's effectiveness at communicating with numerous amounts of people. The main positive way creators can share this information is by creating informative, high quality content, as people will often watch something as long as they find it visually appealing. In addition to this, there are lots of qualified experts on this topic who are on the app as well. For people who are willing to sit down and listen, this qualified expert can share small, condensed, and digestible bits of information. that can be easily understood and retained. This allows for a more engaging and educational experience for viewers, ultimately contributing to the app's success in reaching a wide audience. By incorporating visuals, such as infographics or animations, creators can further enhance the educational value of their content. This will not only attract more viewers but also help them better comprehend and remember the information being presented. For instance, popular environmental hashtags like #ClimateChange, #ZeroWaste, and #EcoFriendly have garnered billions of views on TikTok. These hashtags have sparked conversations and raised awareness about important environmental issues, reaching a diverse global audience. By using catchy visuals and engaging content, creators on TikTok are able to effectively communicate complex ideas in a way that resonates with viewers of all ages. As a result, the platform has become a powerful tool for educating and inspiring positive change in the world.  
  

Despite the amount of positive influence that the app could have on the environment and making positive change for the world, there are some negatives that come with the app. While there can be positive trends, there can also be negative trends that incentivize people to pollute and cause unnecessary damage to the environment by popularizing a trend, focusing on it, or even making it acceptable or funny to do so. It is important for users to be mindful of the content they engage with and promote on the platform, as it can have a significant impact on shaping societal norms and behaviors. By actively supporting and promoting environmentally conscious content, individuals can help steer the platform towards fostering positive change for the world. Additionally, some well-intentioned but misguided trends can emerge, promoting ineffective or even harmful practices. For instance, certain DIY environmental hacks may lack scientific validity and could result in unintended consequences. In addition to creating negative trends, the fast-paced nature of TikTok content can contribute to a superficial understanding of complex environmental issues. While short videos are effective for capturing attention, they often lack the depth and context necessary for comprehensive education. This limitation can result in users gaining only a fragmented understanding of environmental challenges and solutions. Furthermore, the pressure to create engaging and viral content on TikTok can lead content creators to prioritize entertainment value over accuracy. This can perpetuate misinformation and misconceptions about environmental issues, ultimately hindering genuine progress towards sustainability. It is important for users to critically evaluate the information they consume on social media platforms like TikTok and seek out reliable sources for accurate and informed perspectives on environmental issues. By being mindful of the limitations of short-form content and actively seeking out credible information, users can better educate themselves and contribute to meaningful change in the fight against environmental degradation.

In conclusion, the app can have a massive variety of effects on the consumer and the world because of its far reach as well as its easily digestible content. Users must also consider the impact of their own actions on the environment and strive to make more sustainable choices in their daily lives. By sharing accurate information and spreading awareness about pressing environmental issues, users can inspire others to take action and collectively work towards a more sustainable future. Ultimately, the power of social media platforms like TikTok lies in their ability to mobilize and unite individuals in the fight against environmental degradation.
