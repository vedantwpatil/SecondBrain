# Vim

**Definition:** Vim is a code/text editor, the other name for this software is called an [[IDE]] which stands for integrated development environment. The uniqueness about vim is that there are many commands which allow you to be really efficient in using it as well as you're able to setup and really personalize your environment for your software development needs. 

### Vim Planning:
- Currently I've been looking to learn vim as its something which is highly recommended in the software engineering space as something which is considered to be really useful.
- I've tried getting through vim multiple times however I constantly find myself at a roadblock because of how difficult I find it to map my mind to the key binds and reconfigure my muscle memory
