There are more manga's I really enjoy however I constantly find myself coming back to these as my favorite as I consider them to be the most 'life changing' and thought provoking with each other them holding important messages and themes. 
# Big 3:

There are 3 major manga which people consider to be the  pinnacle of storytelling and is something which the manga has came to consensus about. The big 3 manga consists of [[Berserk]], [[Vagabond]], and [[Vinland Saga]]. These 3 are all seinen stories which feature lots of action and have their characters develop from brutal killing machines into realizing they have a greater purpose than just that. Here are the major themes/lessons I've taken away from these series 
## Berserk

From berserk I find myself looking up to the protagonist Gut's willpower and his determination. Despite all the suffering he ends up going through he finds the ability within himself to continue on and find some purpose with his life. He starts living off of hatred and vengeance but inevitably realizes that there is more to life and starts to live for the happiness of others. 

## Vagabond 


## Vinland Saga
