# Introduction to Algorithms

This document will serve as something which will serve as a hub for all the content about the book introduction to algorithms

**Definition:** This is the index for all the notes about the text introduction to algorithms, I am reading this book to become a better [[Software Engineer]] as to pass the interviews the most common thing that are asked are questions on [[Algorithms]] and [[Data Structures]]

**General Knowledge:** 
- The book uses a model named the RAM model which assumes a computer with a single processor that can perform basic arithmetic and bitwise operations 
- Assumes each word of data has a fixed size of c log n bits
	- Allows indexing into the array using a single element
- Assumes unbounded amount of memory which is able to access any element in constant time 
- Counts the number of machine instructions executed to measure running time
### Chapters
- [[Foundations]] 
- [[Sorting and Ordering Statstics]]
- [[Data Structures]]
- [[Advanced Design and Analysis Techniques]]
- [[Advanced Data Structures ]]
- [[Graph Algorithms ]]
- [[Selected Topics]]
