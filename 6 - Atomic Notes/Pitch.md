Hi, my name is Vedant and I moved around a lot but I'm from jersey. I spent alot of time playing sports and being competitive and some of my favorite things to do to is play or watch soccer. Since moving around alot *I found myself being pulled in multiple directions throughout life and I found this to be especially true when it came to figuring out what I was going to do in life*. I happened to take a programming class and have enjoyed it ever since and found that it combines my interests of logic and problem solving and realized that I really enjoyed writing algorithms and found it interesting learning different concepts in programming but also math. I kept taking these programming and maths classes and now I'm here.
