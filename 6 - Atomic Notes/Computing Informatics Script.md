# Computing Informatics Script

**Definition:** This is a script for the final presentation in CI-103


### Technical Demo: 

This snippet of code allows the user to change their address in which they want their search results to pop up in. The program takes in user input in the text field and runs it through a web scraping algorithm which searches for various salons in the area mentioned. This search will find information such as address, ratings and images of the salon online. 
### Process: 

While working on our project we collaborated together using GitLab to host our code with a shared repository. This helped us easily share our work with each other while also utilizing version control. Additionally we used an instagram group chat to communicate outside of class to delegate tasks and check up on others progress. Finally, we used a burndown chart and velocity chart to keep track of our team's performance in addition to a team morale chart to evaluate our team's status. 

### Takeaways: 
One of my major takeaways from working on this project was the difficulty of creating software in a group environment. Throughout the term, there were multiple discussions on the path to take the project and what was the best way to implement something. Factoring in other's opinions was something we found challenging but learned to accommodate throughout the quarter. Additionally learning to communicate more often and check in on the status of our work was something I learned to do as others found it helpful to know where I was with my work and my plan to complete it and that doing this reassured the team that I was making sufficient progress. Finally, something technical that I learned was the usage of APIs and web scraping, I initially attempted to use some APIs to implement some features in our app but was constantly running into paywalls. Because of this, I learned how to scrape information off of the internet for our project. 
# Reference


â€Š This snippet of code allows a user to change the address in which they want their search results to pop up.  The program takes in user input in the text field and runs it through a web scraping algorithm. That searches for various salons in the area mentioned.  This search will find information such as addresses, ratings, and images of the salon online.

While working on our project, we collaborated together using get lab to host rate code with a shared repository.  This helped us easily share our work with each other. Also you do those in version control. Additionally we use the Instagram group, tried to communicate outside of class to delegate tasks and check up on other's progress.  Finally, we use a burndown chart and velocity chart to keep track of our team's performance. In addition to a team where I'll chart to evaluate our team status.  

 One of my major takeaways from working on this project was the difficulty of creating software in a group environment throughout the term, there were multiple discussions on the path to take the project and what was the best way to implement something?  Factoring in others' opinions with something we found challenging, we learned to accommodate throughout the quarter.  Additionally, learning to communicate more often and check in on the status of my work or something. I learned to do as other son, it helpful to know where I was at my work and my plan to complete it.  This assured them. That I was making sufficient progress with my work and I was on track.  Finally something technical that I learned. Was it uses of APS and landscaping. I initially attempted to use some APS, implement some functionality in our app was constantly running the paywalls. Because of this. I found a workaround and this will work scraping.
